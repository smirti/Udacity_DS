# Covid-19 Dataset


### This Project demostrates the countries suffering from this virus. The 10 most virus infected countries.I have also analyzed the dataset for New Zealand where there is only 1 active cases and seen their testing. I wanted to see how some countries are doing really good interms of controlling and some countries are not able to contain. USA is currently the top and New Zealand is in the lowest.

### I have used two dataset owid-covid-data and full_data csv. The first "owid" consists of the testing numbers of the countries and second full_date consists of the new cases and new deaths all over the world.The dataset was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing and kaggle.com. 

### I have used basic analysis and seen the top 10 countries in terms of the new cases and new deaths. I have also attempted to perform a time series forecast using ARIMA. 

### I found that USA is in the top list in terms of the virus and the major reason is the no of tests being conducted and the lack of strict stay at home order. New Zealand conducted the highest number of tests although their active cases were less within 5, the no of test conducted were more than 5000 per day. The lockdown was done more strictly and in the very beginning phase. That is the reason, New Zealand is a successful story.
